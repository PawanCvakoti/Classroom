    <h1>My Experience</h1>
    <p>I didn't know how to do coding and what to do to do coding before I came to NAMI college. After I joined NAMI I got to know more about coding and much more. Before that, I had never used HTML, CSS, etc to make anything, but after I started learning to code I struggled a little during my first few weeks to understand the basics of HTML and CSS but after a few weeks I started creating simple designs using HTML and CSS on my own. Since I had just started learning web development(coding), I faced many problems like confusion in selecting correct tags, no proper understanding of the CSS flex-box, spelling mistakes, forgetting closing tags, etc while creating simple designs, but I never gave up and solved all the problems that I faced while doing my assignments and always completed my assignments in time. Some of my designs that I have created till now as a beginner-level programmer are shown below.
    </p>

    	<img src="Form1.png" alt="assignment3" class="img2">
    </div>
    <p>As I have mentioned above, I am in the early stages of learning to code, so it was quite difficult for me to do such a huge assignment of creting a whole portfolio and I tried my best to make it look attractive, and I enjoyed very much while doing this project. I learned a lot of new things while doing this assignment and improved my coding skills a little. One of the main problems I got  when I joined NAMI college was that I didn't even have my personal computer to learn to code, and it is due to my family's weak financial situation and even now I'm doing my assignment on my brother's friend's laptop.</p>
    <h1>Module Experience</h1>
    <p>Talking about module experience it is quite fun learning Web Development with Ankit Thapa sir. He is a student-friendly teacher and teaches so simply that it becomes easier for us to understand lectures. Web Development is not as easy subject as I thought it would be, but reading this subject is a lot of fun and new experience. In the first week of my college, Ankit sir taught us about Git and GitHub which was quite easy but after that Ankit Sir taught us coding which at first seemed difficultt but then after practicing it regularly it became a little easier. Whatever Ankit Sir used to teach us in the college, I used to practice that at home, which has increased my coding skills and knowledge a little. After every lecture Ankit sir used to give us assignment which helped me a lot to learn HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h1>My Decision</h1>
	<p>When I saw the assignment for the first time I thought that how a beginner-level programmer like me can create a portfolio website with this basic knowledge of HTML and CSS but when I started creating my assignment my confidence level improved. When I started my assignment, I had no idea how to make or start my assignment, but then I started trying out different ideas like different methods of creating responsive navbar, selecting suitable font style, background images, color, etc and used the ideas I liked. It took me around two and half days only to design the navbar and the Home page as it was all new for me. I haven't used a lot of animations and effects on my website because I want to keep my website as simple as possible.</p> 
	<div class="exp-img">
    	<img src="Responsive2.png" alt="Hamburgericon-menu" class="img2">
    	<img src="Responsive3.png" alt="Hamburgericon-menu-cros-sign" class="img2">
    </div>
    <p>Although I haven't been able to make my website very good, I have made it easy to use on both mobile and computer by placing a fully functional hamburger icon, making it very easy for people to run my website on both mobile and computer. Talking about where I got the idea to design my website, I first asked my uncle's son about various ideas and designs as he is also studing computer engineering and also watched some videos from youtube. I have provided below the link of all those youtube channels, from where I have taken ideas to design my website (link in respective sections). </p>
    <a href="index.html"><h1>Home Page</h1></a>
    <h3>Date:May 18, 2021</h3>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <div class="exp-img">
        <img src="Responsive2.png" alt="Home-Page" class="img2">
        <img src="Responsive3.png" alt="Home-Page" class="img2">
    </div> 
     <p>At the top of the homepage, I have a responsive navigation menu that adjusts automatically to the width of our device and hides behind the hamburger icon on the mobile. When using this website on mobile, the navigation menu hides behind the hamburger icon and the navigation menu only appears when the users click on the hamburger icon. With the help of this navigation menu, users can go from page to page. If you look on the left side of the navigation menu there is an About Me section in which I have written about myself, when we reduce the width of the device the About Me section goes to the right side of the screen as the hamburger icon appears on the left side to hide the menu. The layout of this navigation menu is consistent across each page of the website. Looking at the middle of this homepage, I haven't written much, just my little introduction and the logo of my portfolio because I wanted to keep my homepage simple.</p>
     <h2>Problems</h2>
    <div class="exp-img">
        <img src="mistake.png" alt="Hamburgericon-Problem" class="img2">
        <img src="mistake1.png" alt="Hamburgericon-Problem" class="img2">
    </div>  
     <p>I have two mistakes in this hamburger icon which I tried hard to correct but could not.Every time I tried to correct these mistakes, my other things started to go wrong, which is why I left these mistakes like this only. My first mistake is that the background color is fine when there is a navigation menu, but when the device width is reduced to mobile width, the background color behind the hamburger icon and the About Me section spoils. Another mistake is when we open the navigation menu by clicking on the hamburger icon, the menu goes up when scrolling but the cross sign of the hamburger icon and About Me section are fixed and not scrolled up. This happened due to the use of fixed positioning because we were not allowed to use the absolute positioning.</p>
     <h2>Validation</h2>

        <img src="indexvalidation.png" alt="IndexValidation" class="img3">

    <p>The photo above proves that all the codes on my index.html page are valid.</p>
    <h2>Code Reference</h2>
    <p>I had no idea of how to make a hamburger icon and even in college we were not taught how to make a functional hamburger icon, so I took the help from youtube to make a hamburger icon and I have given the reference of those youtube channels in the reference section.</p>

Below the welcome text, I have placed placeholder images for my future projects in which I have used a dummy image whose link I have given in the reference section. Below the placeholder images, I have left space for the date, project title, and project description for my future projects. And I have used a total of eight placeholder images on this portfolio page.When the mouse is moved over the placeholder images of portfolio page then the placeholder images moves up slightly and a shadow effect is also seen behind it.</p>

In the box on the right side, I have written about my education, experience, interest, and social media account. Since I have just started my computer engineering, so I have left the section of experience blank due to lack of experience. When the mouse is moved over the boxes of CV then the box moves up slightly and a shadow effect is also seen behind it.
