    <h1>My Experience</h1>
    <p>I didn't know how to do coding and what to do to do coding before I came to NAMI college. After I joined NAMI I got to know more about coding and much more. Before that, I had never used HTML, CSS, etc to make anything, but after I started learning to code I struggled a little during my first few weeks to understand the basics of HTML and CSS but after a few weeks I started creating simple designs using HTML and CSS on my own. Since I had just started learning web development(coding), I faced many problems like confusion in selecting correct tags, no proper understanding of the CSS box model and CSS flex-box, spelling mistakes, forgetting closing tags, etc while creating simple designs, but I never gave up and solved all the problems that I faced while doing my assignments and always completed my assignments in time. Some of my designs that I have created till now as a beginner-level programmer are shown below.
    </p>
    <div class="exp-img">

    	<img src="Responsive5.png" alt="assignment3" class="img2">
    	<img src="Form1.png" alt="assignment3" class="img2">
    </div>
    <p>As I have mentioned above, I am in the early stages of learning to code, so it was quite difficult for me to do such a huge assignment of creating a whole portfolio and I tried my best to make it look attractive, and I enjoyed it very much while doing this project. I learned a lot of new things while doing this assignment and improved my coding skills a little. One of the main problems I got when I joined NAMI college was that I didn't even have my personal computer to learn to code, and it is due to my family's weak financial situation and even now I'm doing my assignment on my brother's friend's laptop.</p>
    <h1>Module Experience</h1>
    <p>Talking about module experience it is quite fun learning Web Development with Ankit Thapa sir. He is a student-friendly teacher and teaches so simply that it becomes easier for us to understand lectures. Web Development subject is not as easy as I thought, but reading this subject is a lot of fun and a new experience. In the first week of my college, Ankit sir taught us about Git and GitHub which was quite easy, but then Ankit Sir taught us coding which at first seemed difficultt but then after practicing it regularly it became a little easier. Whatever Ankit Sir used to teach us in the college, I used to practice that at home, which has increased my coding skills and knowledge a little. After every lecture, Ankit sir used to give us assignments which helped me a lot to learn HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h1>My Decision</h1>
	<p>When I saw the assignment for the first time I wondered how a beginner-level programmer like me who has such basic knowledge of HTML and CSS could create a complete portfolio website but when I started doing this assignment my confidence level kept increasing. When I started doing this assignment, I had no idea how to make or start this assignment, but then I started trying out different ideas like different ways to create a responsive navigation menu, selecting suitable font style, background images, color, and many more, and just used the ideas that I liked. It took me more than five days only to create a navigation menu and the Home page because it was all new to me. I didn't use a lot of animations and effects on this website because I wanted to keep this website as simple as possible.</p> 
	<div class="exp-img">
    	<img src="Responsive2.png" alt="Hamburgericon-menu" class="img2">
    	<img src="Responsive3.png" alt="Hamburgericon-menu-cros-sign" class="img2">
    </div>
    <p>Although I haven't made this website very good, I have made it easy to use on both mobile and computer by placing a fully functional hamburger icon, making it very easy for people to run my website on both mobiles and computers. Talking about where I got the idea to design my website, I first asked my uncle's son about various ideas and designs as he is also studing computer engineering and also watched some videos from YouTube. I have provided below the link to all those YouTube channels, from where I have taken ideas to design my website (link in respective sections).</p>
    <a href="index.html"><h1>Home Page</h1></a>
    <h3>Date:May 18, 2021</h3>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <div class="exp-img">
        <img src="Responsive2.png" alt="Home-Page" class="img3">
    </div> 
     <p>At the top of the home page, there is a responsive navigation menu that adjusts automatically to the width of our device and hides behind the hamburger icon on the mobile. When using this website on mobile, the navigation menu hides behind the hamburger icon and the navigation menu only appears when the users click on the hamburger icon. With the help of this navigation menu, users can easily move from one page to another. If you look on the left side of this navigation menu, there is an About Me section in which I have written about myself, when we reduce the width of the device then the About Me section goes to the right side of the screen because on the left side, the hamburger icon appears to hide the menu. The layout of this navigation menu is consistent across each page of the website. Looking at the middle of this homepage, I haven't written much, just my little introduction and the logo of my portfolio because I wanted to keep my homepage simple. When we move the mouse over the text written in the middle, we can see the color changing and text-shadow hover effects behind the texts.</p>

Below the placeholder images, I have left space for the date, project title, and project description for my future projects. When we move the mouse over the placeholder images of the portfolio page, the placeholder images moves up slightly and a shadow effect is also seen behind it.</p>

In the box on the right side, I have written about my education, experience, interest, and social media account. Since I have just started my computer engineering, so I have left the section of experience blank due to lack of experience. When we move the mouse over the boxes of CV, the boxes moves up slightly and a shadow effect is also seen behind it. In the social section of the box on the right side, I have placed the icons of Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, which when clicked redirects users to my social media accounts.</p>
