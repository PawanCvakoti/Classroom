    <h1>My Experience</h1>
    <p>I did not know how coding is done and what to do to perform coding before coming to NAMI. After I joined NAMI I got to know more about coding and much more. Before that, I had never used HTML, CSS, etc to make anything, but after I started learning to code I struggled a little during my first few weeks to understand the basics of HTML and CSS but after a few weeks I started creating simple designs using HTML and CSS on my own. Since I had just started learning web development(coding), I faced many problems like confusion in selecting correct tags, no proper understanding of the CSS flex-box, spelling mistakes, forgetting closing tags, etc while creating simple designs, but I never gave up and solved all the problems that I faced while doing my assignments and always completed my assignments in time. Some of my designs that I have created till now as a beginner-level programmer are shown below.

    <p>As I have mentioned above, I am in the early stages of learning to code, so it was quite difficult for me to do such a huge assignment of creting a whole portfolio and I tried my best to make it look attractive, and I enjoyed very much while doing this project. I learned a lot of new things while doing this assignment and improved my coding skills a little. </p>
    <h1>Module Experience</h1>
    <p>Talking about module experience it is quite fun learning Web Development with Ankit Thapa sir. He is a student-friendly teacher and teaches so simply that it becomes easier for us to understand lectures. Web Development is not as easy subject as I thought it would be, but reading this subject is a lot of fun and new experience. In the first week of my college, Ankit sir taught us about Git and GitHub which was quite easy but after that Ankit Sir taught us coding which at first seemed difficultt but then after practicing it regularly it became a little easier. Whatever Ankit Sir used to teach us in the college, I used to practice that at home, which has increased my coding skills and knowledge a little. After every lecture Ankit sir used to give us assignment which helped me a lot to learn HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h1>My Decision</h1>
	<p>When I saw the assignment for the first time I thought that how a beginner-level programmer like me can create a portfolio website with this basic knowledge of HTML and CSS but when I started creating my assignment my confidence level improved. When I started my assignment, I had no idea how to make or start my assignment, but then I started trying out differnt ideas like different methods of creating responsive navbar, selecting suitable font style, background images, color, etc. It took me around two and half days only to design the navbar and the Home page as it was all new for me.</p>
