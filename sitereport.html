    <h1>My Experience</h1>
    <p>I didn't know much about coding before I came to NAMI college. After I joined NAMI, I got to know more about coding and much more. Before that, I had never used HTML and CSS to make anything, but after I started learning to code, I struggled a little during my first few weeks to understand the basics of HTML and CSS, but after a few weeks, I started creating simple designs using HTML and CSS on my own. Since I have just started learning web development(coding), I faced many problems like confusion in selecting correct tags, no proper understanding of the CSS box model and CSS flex-box, spelling mistakes, forgetting closing tags while creating simple designs. However, I never gave up and solved all the problems that I faced while doing my assignments and always completed my assignments in time. Some of the designs that I have created till now as a beginner-level programmer are shown below.
    </p>
    <div class="grid-img">
        <img src="Responsive1.png" alt="assignment1" class="img2 img6">
        <img src="Responsive4.png" alt="assignment2" class="img2 img7">

        <img src="Form1.png" alt="assignment4" class="img2 img9">
    </div>
    <p>As I have mentioned above, I am in the early stages of learning to code, so it was a bit difficult for me to do such a huge assignment of creating a whole portfolio and I have tried my best to make it look attractive, and I have enjoyed it while doing this assignment. I learned a lot of new things while doing this assignment and improved my coding skills a little. One of the main problems I got when I joined NAMI college was that I didn't even have my personal laptop or computer to learn to code, and it is due to my family's weak financial situation and even now I'm doing my assignment on my brother's friend's laptop. I'm not saying that it's my family's fault, but it's a little difficult for me to use other's laptops like this.</p>
    <h1>Module Experience</h1>
    <p>Talking about module experience, it is quite fun learning Web Development with Ankit Thapa sir. He is a student-friendly teacher and teaches so simply that it becomes easier for us to understand lectures. Web Development is not as easy as I thought, but reading this subject is a lot of fun and a new experience. In the first week of my college, Ankit sir taught us about Git, GitHub, and Git Bash, which was relatively easy, but then Ankit Sir taught us coding, which initially seemed difficult, but after practicing it regularly, it became a little easier. Whatever Ankit Sir used to teach us in the college, I used to practice that at home, which has increased my coding skills and knowledge a little. After every lecture, Ankit sir used to give us assignments which helped me a lot to learn HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h1>My Decision</h1>
    <p>When I saw the assignment for the first time, I wondered how a beginner-level programmer like me with such basic knowledge of HTML and CSS could create a complete portfolio website, but when I started doing this assignment, my confidence level kept increasing. When I started doing this assignment, I had no idea how to make or start this assignment, but then I started trying out different ideas like different ways to create a responsive navigation menu, selecting suitable font style, background images, color, and many more, and just used the ideas that I liked. It took me more than five days to create a navigation menu and the Home page because it was all new to me. To give this website a 3D look and make it attractive, I have used text-shadow effects and various color combinations in many places on this website.</p> 
    <div class="grid-img1">
        <img src="Responsive2.png" alt="Navigation- Menu" class="img3">
        <img src="Responsive3.png" alt="Hamburgericon-menu" class="img3">
    </div>
    <p>Although I haven't made this website very good, I have made it easy to use on both mobile and computer by placing a fully functional hamburger icon, making it very easy for people to run this website on both mobiles and computers. Talking about where I got the idea to design my website, First I asked my uncle's son about various ideas and designs as he is also studying computer engineering, and he gave me a lot of ideas to start a project, but I never copied the ideas he gave me, I used those ideas by modifying them in my way and also watched some videos from YouTube. I have provided below the link to all those YouTube channels, from where I have taken ideas to design my website (link in respective sections).</p>
    <a href="index.html"><h1>Home Page</h1></a>
    <h3>Date:May 18, 2021</h3>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <div class="grid-img1">
        <div class="img-text">
            <img src="indexbefore.png" alt="Home-Page" class="img3">
            <h2>Before</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="img-text">
            <img src="Responsive2.png" alt="Home-Page" class="img3">
            <h2>After</h2>
        </div>
    </div> 
     <p>At the top of this page is a responsive navigation menu that automatically adjusts to the width of our device and hides behind the hamburger icon on the mobile, and is visible only when the users click on the hamburger icon. With the help of this navigation menu, users can quickly move from one page to another. If you look on the left side of this navigation menu, there is an "About Me" section in which I have written about myself. When we reduce the device's width, the "About Me" section goes to the right side of the screen because the hamburger icon appears to hide the menu on the left side. The layout of this navigation menu is consistent across each page of the website. I have used the color-changing hover effect in the navigation menu. To indicate which page we are on, I have made the background color of that page's link button to be white. Looking at the middle of this page, I have not written much, just my little introduction and the logo of my portfolio. When we hover over the text "And This Is My", the texts moves slightly upwards, and the texts color changes to the background color and vice-versa. I have used color-changing animation in the portfolio logo, and when we click on the portfolio logo, the portfolio page opens. The purpose of creating this page is to introduce this website and direct users to other pages.</p>
    <h2>Code Reference</h2>
    <p>I didn't know how to make a hamburger icon, and even in college, we were not taught how to make a functional hamburger icon, so I took the help from YouTube to make a hamburger icon, and I have given the reference of those YouTube channels in the reference section below.</p>

     <p>At the top of this page is a responsive navigation menu about which I have already described in the homepage section. Below the navigation menu, I have put a small welcome text in which I have used 3D text-shadow animation. Below the welcome text, I have placed six placeholder images using the grid for my future works in which I have used a dummy image whose link I have given in the reference section. Below each placeholder image, I have left a space to write the work date, title, and work description for my future works. When we hover over the placeholder images, the placeholder images moves slightly upwards, and a shadow effect is also seen behind it. The purpose of creating this page is to place placeholder images that will be replaced with my future works.</p>

     <p>At the top of this page is a responsive navigation menu about which I have already described in the homepage section.  Below the navigation menu, I have placed the page heading as Curriculum Vitae, under which I have created my CV. In CV, I have made three boxes using the grid. I put my photo and name in the box on the top left, and in the box below, I have written about my contact information and skills. I have written about my education, experience, interest, and social media account in the box on the right side. Since I have just started my computer engineering, I have left the section of experience blank due to lack of experience. When we hover over the boxes of CV, the boxes moves slightly upwards, and a shadow effect is also seen behind it. In the social section of the box on the right side, I have placed Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter icons that redirect users to my social media accounts when clicked. The purpose of creating this page is to keep information about my contact details, skills, education, experience, interests, and social media accounts.</p>

    <p>At the top of this page is a responsive navigation menu about which I have already described in the homepage section. With the help of the grid, I have placed my contact information on the left side of this contact page and a form on the right side using which viewers can send me emails. When we hover over the contact page form, the form moves slightly upwards, and a shadow effect is also seen behind it. The purpose of creating this page is to keep my contact details and a form so that viewers can contact or mail me.</p>
    <h2>Icon Reference</h2>
    <p>I have used three icons on this page, which I have taken from a website called <b>Flaticon</b>, and I have given the reference to each icon I have used on this page in the reference section below. I didn't put the author's name and upload date of these icons in the reference because that website didn't show the author's name and upload date.</p>

    <p>On this page, I have written about my experience of learning the basics of web development, module experience, every decision I made while making this website, and the validation, design, problems, and references of each page. I have used the text-shadow effect to give the texts of this page a 3D and bold look. Thinking of doing something new, I put the position-changing animation in the first four photos of this site report using a grid. I put position-changing animation in the first four photos because the assignments shown in those four photos were the first four assignments I have done, in which I wanted to try something new. I have used the grid to place all the images and icons on this page.</p>
