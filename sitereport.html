<h1>My Experience</h1>
<p>I did not know how coding is done and what to do to perform coding before coming to NAMI. After I joined NAMI I got to know more about coding and much more. Before that, I had never used HTML, CSS, etc to make anything, but after I started learning to code I struggled a little during my first few weeks to understand the basics of HTML and CSS but after a few weeks I started creating simple designs using HTML and CSS on my own. Since I had just started learning web development(coding), I faced many problems while creating simple designs. Some of my designs that I have created till now as a beginner-level programmer are shown below.
